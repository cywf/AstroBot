# AstroBot

AstroBot is a scalable algorithmic trading bot designed to explore diverse markets, automate strategies, and adapt for future innovations in trading technology.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Automated trading strategies with flexibility for customization.
- Containerized development environment for secure and isolated testing.
- Open-source under the MIT License to promote collaboration and learning.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines to ensure robust and secure development practices.

## Props to MoonDev
AstroBot's foundation was inspired by the incredible resources and teaching provided by [MoonDev](https://www.youtube.com/@moondevonyt). If you're interested in diving deeper into algorithmic trading, I highly recommend his **15-Day Bootcamp**, which offers a structured and comprehensive introduction to building trading bots. You can learn more about it [here](https://algotradecamp.com/2024-update57970432).

## Why the MIT License?
AstroBot is open-source under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which aligns with the project's goals of fostering collaboration and community-driven development. By using the MIT License:
- Developers are free to use, modify, and distribute the project with minimal restrictions.
- It encourages innovation and transparency, allowing others to contribute or fork the project.

Additionally, the MIT License is complemented by a robust CI/CD pipeline plan:
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated testing to ensure any changes to the codebase are secure and functional.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Streamlined processes to deploy updates with minimal manual intervention.
- Regular code scans and security audits will be integrated into the CI/CD workflows to prevent potential vulnerabilities and maintain a high level of code quality.

## Getting Started

**WIP** - _please tune into the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/cywf/AstroBot/discussions) and [Project Board](https://github.com/users/cywf/projects/86) for development updates and progress_

## Roadmap

This is an evolving project. Key milestones include:
- [ ] Setting up initial trading bot strategies.
- [ ] Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Scaling and refining the bot for real-world application.
